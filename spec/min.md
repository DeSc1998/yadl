The language spec is still under construction, but you can start with the following basics:


1. Variable assignments
`x = 3 + 5`
`y = x * y`
`z = fn(x, y)`

2. Functions
`let add = (x, y) => x+y`
Functions have their own scope!

3. Arithmetic on numbers

4. String concatination

5. Boolean logik (keywords: and, or, not)
